## Introduction
This project is the culmination of the Module 3 curriculum, combining algorithmic problem-solving skills with the development of an interactive web application. The primary objectives are:
1. To solve logical problems using JavaScript through 20 unique algorithms.
2. To develop a dynamic, user-friendly webpage that communicates with a public API using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

By completing this project, I will demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript, problem-solving, and web development fundamentals.

 Features

 Algorithms
- Solve 20 Algorithms: Organized in the `algorithms` folder, with each solution in its respective file (e.g., `exercise1.js`, `exercise2.js`, etc.).
- Best Practices: Emphasis on proper use of loops, conditionals, functions, and meaningful naming conventions.

 Web Application
- Data Interaction:
  - Fetch and display data from a public API (GET).
  - Add new data via a form (POST).
  - Update existing data (PUT).
  - Delete data through UI actions (DELETE).
- User Interface:
  - Responsive and visually appealing design.
  - Features a table or list to display API data.
  - Interactive form for adding and editing data.
  - Buttons for data modification and deletion.

## Technologies Used

 Algorithms
- JavaScript: To solve logical problems efficiently.

 Web Application
- HTML5: For semantic structure.
- CSS3: For styling and responsive design.
- JavaScript: To handle DOM manipulation and API requests.
- Fetch: For HTTP requests.
- Git/GitHub: For version control.

 Getting Started

 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code).
- Node.js and npm (if you want to use a development server or Axios).
- Git for version control.

 Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Sppgg/Proyecto-final-modulo-3-JavaScript.git]
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd proyecto-final-modulo-3
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

---

 Configuration

 Web Application
- If using a development server (like Vite):
  1. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
  2. Run the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
  3. Access the project in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

 SASS (Optional)
- To use SASS for enhanced styling:
  1. Install SASS:
     ```bash
     npm install -g sass
     ```
  2. Compile SASS to CSS:
     ```bash
     sass styles.scss styles.css
     ```

---

 Usage

 Algorithms
- Navigate to the `algorithms` folder.
- Open and run each JavaScript file (`exercise1.js`, `exercise2.js`, etc.) to see the solutions.

 Web Application
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Explore the functionalities:
   - View data fetched from the API.
   - Add new data using the form.
   - Edit existing data by clicking the edit button.
   - Delete unwanted data with the delete button.
